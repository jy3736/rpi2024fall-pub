# Odd or Even Number Checker Assignment

## Overview
In this assignment, you are required to complete a C++ program that determines whether a given integer is odd or even. The incomplete code is provided, and your task is to fill in the missing parts to make the program functional. Once completed, the program will take an integer as input and output either "Even" or "Odd" based on the number's parity.

## Instructions

1. **Complete the Code**:
   - You will be provided with an incomplete C++ file named `main.cpp`.
   - Your task is to complete the code so that it correctly identifies whether a number is odd or even.

2. **Save the File**:
   - Ensure that the completed code is saved in a file named `main.cpp`.

3. **Compile the Program**:
   - Use the following command in your terminal or command prompt to compile the code:
     ```bash
     g++ -o main main.cpp
     ```

4. **Run the Program**:
   - After compiling, run the program with the following command:
     ```bash
     ./main
     ```

5. **Input**:
   - The program will prompt you to enter an integer. Provide an integer and press `Enter`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program will output `Even` if the entered integer is divisible by 2, otherwise it will output `Odd`.

## Example

### Example 1:
```bash
lab01>$ g++ -o main main.cpp 
lab01>$ ./main 
10
Even
lab01>$ ./main 
3
Odd
lab01>$
```
