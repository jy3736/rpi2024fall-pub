# Hello, World! Repeater Assignment

## Overview
In this assignment, you are required to write a C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" a specified number of times. The program should take an integer input from the user, which indicates how many times "Hello, World!" should be printed.

## Instructions

1. **Write the Code**:
   - Create a C++ file named `main.cpp`.
   - Write a program that reads an integer from the user and then prints "Hello, World!" that many times.

2. **Save the File**:
   - Ensure that your completed code is saved in a file named `main.cpp`.

3. **Compile the Program**:
   - Use the following command in your terminal or command prompt to compile your code:
     ```bash
     g++ -o main main.cpp
     ```

4. **Run the Program**:
   - After compiling, run the program with the following command:
     ```bash
     ./main
     ```

5. **Input**:
   - The program should read an integer input directly without displaying any prompt string.

6. **Output**:
   - The program should output "Hello, World!" the specified number of times, each on a new line, without any additional prompt or text.
